# Game Project Self Assessment
For this unit, you will demonstrate your learning through your engagement with
the concepts and skills specific to object-oriented programming we have covered
in this unit as well as general concepts and skills present throughout the
world of computer science. Your engagement with each criterion will be evidenced
by elements included in your project. However, this evidence alone may not speak
to depth to which you engaged with the criteria. As such, in addition to
providing specific pieces of evidence you should provide a justification for how
the piece(s) of evidence you identified demonstrate your level of engagement with
the criterion.

View the [full rubric](https://cs.fablearn.org/projects/2-game%20project.html) to see examples of evidence and justification
for each criterion.

### Using the rubric
For each criterion you should:

1. Read the description of the criterion as it applies to this project.
1. Identify 1-5 elements of your project that evidence your engagement with the criterion.
1. Justify how the piece(s) of evidence demonstrate your engagement with the criteria.
1. Determine the level between 1-8 that represents your engagement with the criterion based on the evidence and justification.

## Criterion A: Knowing, understanding, and computational thinking
*In this unit, we explored the **object-oriented programming paradigm**.
This allowed us to **cluster related data into objects** and identify
repeatedly used clusters of data to form **classes of objects**. Further,
we explored the **inheritance and composition relationships** of classes
to allow for extended functionality.*

### Evidence of engagement

#### Piece of evidence
*game.py Line 19 "Game Class"*

*Justification of engagement:
So here, we decided to extend a class instead of writing a new class. This was
because our game was quite similar to that of the parent class, and we would
also use code from the parent class, so we decided to extend the class so it
would make it simpler and easier to debug.*

#### Piece of evidence
*puzzle.py Line 182 "portal class"*

Justification of engagement:
*So here, I added a new class. I did this instead of extending another class was
because I would have many different functions for the different sprites, such as
a pickup function for the item sprites, a teleport function for the portal sprite,
a pirate dialogue function for the piratelord sprite etc.*


#### Piece of evidence
*game.py Line 76 "setup_npcs"*

Justification of engagement:
*Here, we decided to override the parent setup_npcs function because we needed
to input the sprites into the game. we could have just made a new function, but
we would then need to change where it calls the setup_npcs function to our new
function, which would waste a lot of time for something that is unnecassary.*

#### Grade
We think that we should get a 7 on this strand, as we have provided multiple pieces of evidence which
showed us fulfilling this criteria.
--------------------------------------------------------------------


## Criterion B: Planning and development
*In this unit, you saw different approaches to **planning a project** as
well as an approach to **incremental feature development**. Additionally,
you **collaborated on a project as a group**. Finally, you have
experienced the importance of the **documentation of a project** to those trying to use the project.*

### Evidence of engagement

#### Piece of evidence
There are many examples of us writing a description throughout our code but here is a few:
line 19, 28-29,43 of puzzle.py

Justification of engagement:
*Below each function or class that we have written there will be a short sentence
to summarise what the function/code written below. This is to ensure that our
teammates understand and is able to use the code/function with out any large
misunderstandings. Describing our code is very important because if another teammate
reads a new code that has been written, they would have to read the whole entire
code to understand it's functions. If the teammate/author of the code wrote a
small summary of the code that they have wrote, it would save time and make it easier
for others to use and understand the code.*


#### Piece of evidence
*Google meet. A platform where you can meet with other through devices. During our
class times, we use this platform to discuss and work on the code as a team.*

Justification of engagement:
*During our class times we attend a google meet to discuss and help each other
with the code for the game. This platform allows us to talk to each other and
share our screens, these functions allow us to understand how to overcome a
specific bug.*


#### Piece of evidence
*Discord. A platform that allows people to text and voice call.*

Justification of engagement:
*When we do not have any classes, we use Discord to call and further discuss
any issues or misunderstandings we have with the game code. Discord is very useful
and works similarly to google meets. We have used this platform many times and it
has became an app that we use regularly to communicate with each other at home.*



--------------------------------------------------------------------


## Criterion C: Evaluation
*Throughout the unit, you learned to **use a suite of tests to make sure
your code was functioning** as expected. Additionally, during the project
you **play-tested your game** with another group in order to get feedback
on specific elements of your gameâ€™s functionality or playability.*

### Evidence of engagement

#### Piece of evidence
*Fixing game.py commit*

Justification of engagement:
*In line 62 of puzzle.py in this commit, we added a function which whenever we ran
into a sprite would print the number of sprites in the game. We did this so we would
know how many sprites currently existed, as we needed to know how many sprites existed
for our functions.*


#### Piece of evidence
*Changing the game after we run it*

Justification of engagement:
*To make my game work, we had to run the game and see if there were any errors while
we were playing the game. We did this to make sure my game was working, so we had a product,
but we also did this to see what we could change about the game. For example, some of
the sprites were too big, so when we noticed that, we changed the sprite scaling.
Through this process, we were able to create a game.*


#### Piece of evidence
*Playtesting*

Justification of engagement:
*Even though we were not able to see each other when we were making the game, we
asked teachers and our family to try play our game to give us some feedback. This
was useful as we were able to develop our game further with their constructive feedback*

### Grade
We think that we should get a 7 on this strand, as we have provided multiple pieces of evidence which
showed us fulfilling this criteria.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


## Criterion D: Reflecting on the impacts of technology
*Throughout the unit, we explored a variety of different games and
considered the **impact games have on players**. Games offer a medium to
**explore new narratives**, provide a venue for **artistic expression**,
and create a context to **experience emotions**.*
